I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost we are your relatives, but it looks a bit empty, try to make everything bigger, but can you make the font bigger? pass the mayo, appeal to the client, sue the vice president , yet remember, everything is the same or better, so this looks perfect. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue. Can you make the blue bluer?. Can you make it pop can it be more retro can you remove my double chin on my business card photo? i don't like the way it looks this was not according to brief, the website doesn't have the theme i was going for.
